<p class="h3" style="color: #7a995d">TLDR: </p>
<p>
We predict the success of Airbnbs around popular tourist destinations, which can inform both tourists and Airbnb owners of pricing and demand. Further, Airbnb proximity and concentration to popular tourist attractions can drive future construction or management of new houses.

<p class="h2">Analysis:</p>
<p class="textp">Our initial analysis of this project was looking at the distributions of airbnbs, hotels, and tourist destinations throughout California. We did this through plotting all the point values of each dataset that we obtained and cleaned through techniques like geocoding on a polygon outline of California. We then were able to find different patterns on these three types of data.</p>

<p class="textp">The major analysis that we tried to achieve through this project was looking and analyzing distances to the nearest lodgings, specifically hotels and airbnbs from tourist destinations throughout California. This was done through using Shapelys nearest point function. The first aspect to this analysis was being able to find the closest point to the tourist destination as well as converting the distance between the tourist destination and airbnb/hotel in miles. This is something different from our initial analysis plan, as we were planning to find the frequencies of visitation at all the tourist destinations, but this was not data that we were able to incorporate, so we decided to adapt. We still were able to create buffers around each tourist destination to try and further our analysis of the hotels and airbnbs in the area nearby. We also were able to query the hotels and airbnbs that were within the decided buffer zone around the tourist destination. Something that we decided to do was to try and focus on a certain area and go more deeply in seeing airbnb and hotel patterns in that specific area, which was different from our initial proposal.</p>

<p class="textp">Using the distances functions that we created, we were able to find the point location of the closest airbnb and hotel to each tourist destination as well as the distance in miles of said location from the tourist destination. We then decided to focus on one specific tourist destination to see if there were any specific patterns visible in the airbnb and hotels within the buffer radius of the tourist destination. We decided to analyze the Oakland Aviation Museum because it was located in the Bay Area which one of the three cluster groups of airbnbs and hotels that we noticed within California. It was also located centrally within the Bay Area cluster. We were then able to find patterns of locations of airbnbs and hotels near the Aviation Museum which will be discussed in a later section.</p>

<p class="textp">We then wanted to see if we could predict the success of Airbnbs using an sklearn SVM model. We based success of an airbnb through its availabilty in the next year, as if it had more openings, it was less successful of an airbnb. The factors that we used in the model were the price of the Airbnb, number of reviews in the last 12 months, and distance to the nearest hotel.</p>

<p class="textp">We had some additional deviations from our original analysis plan, mostly due to data limitations. We did not end up doing the following: finding out whether or not the concentration of lodgings decreases as we get further from the center of the tourist attraction, and if it does, then finding out at what rate the frequency of hotels and Airbnb’s decrease as you get further from the center of the tourist attraction. We felt as though looking at the patterns that airbnbs and hotels in the buffer formed would be more insightful.</p>
