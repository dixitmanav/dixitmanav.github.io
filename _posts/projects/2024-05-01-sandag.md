<p class="h3" style="color: #7a995d">TLDR: </p>
<p class="textp">
Public policy directly affects constituents; thus, city-level decisions should be grounded on real world data. Working with the governemnt agency <a href="https://www.sandag.org/">SANDAG</a>, we develop clustering algorithms on census data to identify emerging hubs of human and economic activity. This data was presented to a team to inform public transit expansion projects across the San Diego County.
